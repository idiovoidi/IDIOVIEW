Organizational media library for curation and sorting of media assets 



## Warning! 
ID:I/O VIEW is very early and most features are broken in my latest version. I've had to do a major refactor to be more component based for performance and extensibility. I started working on ID:I/O VIEW in October, 2024 and have dumped tons of time working solo into it. I wanted to get all the features operational before finally posting but it's taking up too much time for a side project. If people show interest in the project I'd be willing to pick it back up but I'm wanting to finish some other projects before I eventually return to this one.

## üåü Features
### Image Management
- Custom + Standard Metadata support
- Easy JSON Parsing for auto sorting generative content 
- Matplotlib & Seaborn to draw both fun and useful graphs

## Core Concepts
- Metadata written to file to reduce clutter (sidecar alternative) and ensures longevity as a single file 
- Organizational Only, no image processing as there are plenty of solid options. Simply "Open With" suffices

## üîß Installation

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap
- Support for audio and video formats
- Auto-Tagging via AI image recognition and AI auto-tags that can be confirmed into standard tags
- Integration with Stable Diffusion and web platforms for easy reiteration of prompts and settings
- Prompt Manager for sorting the best prompts and breaking them down for re-use in a modular way (might branch off into a seperate project)
- De-Duping (likely Czkawka integration)
