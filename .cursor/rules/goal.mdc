Ideas:
- Dependency injection can decouple components. For example, the MetadataManager shouldn't be directly instantiated in multiple places but injected where needed. This makes testing easier and components more reusable.
- Use composition over inheritance


Use singleton provider classes with dependency injection to ensure instances are kept stable throughout the application.
